# C++ Basic Conditional Programs

This repository contains simple C++ programs demonstrating the use of conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`). Each program solves a small problem suitable for beginners.

## üìÇ List of Programs

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Maximum of Two Numbers
**File:** `Maximum of Two Numbers.cpp`  
This program accepts two integers from the user and determines which one is greater, or if they are equal.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Equality Checker
**File:** `Equality Checker.cpp`  
This program accepts two integers and checks whether they are equal or not.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Day of the Week Mapper
**File:** `Day of the Week Mapper.cpp`  
This program maps a number (1‚Äì7) to the corresponding day of the week:
- 1 = Saturday
- 2 = Sunday
- 3 = Monday
- 4 = Tuesday
- 5 = Wednesday
- 6 = Thursday
- 7 = Friday

If the input is not in 1‚Äì7, it displays an error message.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Number Sign Checker
**File:** `Number Sign Checker.cpp`  
(Note: This file currently contains the same day mapping code as **Day of the Week Mapper**. You may want to replace it with a sign checker that identifies positive, negative, or zero integers.)

## üíª How to Compile and Run

You can compile each program using `g++`:

```bash
g++ "ProgramName.cpp" -o program
./program
